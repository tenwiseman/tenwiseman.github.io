                <p>The Hi-Fi World magazine might not be with us any more, but that won't stop Martin Pipe from covering the Kent Audiojumbles</p>
                
                <p>The Sunday Audiojumbles are key dates for hi-fi enthusiasts living within practical travelling-distance of Tonbridge in Kent. Traditionally, there's one in the winter (usually February), and another in the autumn (October, typically). However, the Covid pandemic threw the organisers' plans out of kilter. The Audiojumble covered here was held at the regular venue - the Angel Centre - on March 5th, although the previous event did indeed follow the familiar October pattern. Due to various factors, though, the organisers have decided to 'skip' a year; sadly, there won't be an event this autumn. The next Audiojumble is scheduled for March 3rd 2024.
                    </p>

                <p>So what makes these events so special to the hundreds of audiophiles - from around the UK...and beyond - who converge on Tonbridge once (or twice) a year? For a start, the Angel Centre venue combines the advantages of accessibility (just off the A21; note too that Tonbridge's railway station isn't far away) and impressive amounts of free parking outside - a concept as rare nowadays as some of the goodies you can expect to find inside, spread over two interconnected halls.</p>

                <p>As well as hi-fi are electronic components, test gear, wind-up gramophones, musical instruments, vintage wireless, tape recorders, amateur radio, cameras, ex-broadcast/studio kit and music in every conceivable format. There's also plenty of broken gear for spares or repair - this tends to be cheap, and it gets even cheaper as the event approaches its 4pm conclusion! The vast majority of the 140-or-so stallholders are not professional traders, but enthusiasts looking to dispose of surplus gear (although they invariably end up with new acquisitions too!).</p>

                <p>There are definite bargains to be had - but you have to be alert! In the past, I scored a Revox B77 for £50; this time around, a £30 Technics SL7 (featured here) proved to be my 'buy of the day'. I've also acquired plenty of rare records and tapes over the years. The 8.30 'early-birds' paid £20 for the privilege of picking over the wares before anyone else (except maybe other traders!) although the majority of visitors opted to file in at 9.30 (paying £12) or 10.30 (£6 entry).</p>

                </div>

                <p>As ever, the overall atmosphere is one of friendliness based on a mutual enthusiasm and love for music, audio and the barely-remembered ephemera of a bygone era. The pace of an Audiojumble is slower than that of a typical hi-fi show. There's plenty of opportunity to discuss relevant subjects with other enthusiasts. It's telling that most visitors seem to be in their 50s or older - i.e. those to whom high-quality listening at home was of paramount importance, given the lack of competing distributions we take for granted today.</p>

                <p>They will recall the 60s/70s 'boom' years for hi-fi sales, a period of history that was well represented at the show - both in equipment (as these photos show!) and the music to play on it! Lovingly displayed on stands were cherished original LP pressings from artists like The Beatles, Pink Floyd (various lineups), Dylan (both acoustic and electric) and Peter Green-era Fleetwood Mac. Hopefully, the Howes 'clan' - who always do such a fine job of organising Audiojumble - will find ways of attracting younger visitors, many of whom also appreciate the fine music the older 'hi-fi generation' enjoyed first time around.</p>

                <p>The next Audiojumble takes place on Sunday 3rd March 2024 at the Angel Leisure Centre, Tonbridge, Kent TN9 1SF.</p>
