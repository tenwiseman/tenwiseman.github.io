                <p>Here's another relic from the early-1970s 'boom' period. The rather substantial 'bi-directional' Goodmans Dimension 8 seen here departed from conventional design...and the design minimalism that was to set in during the following decade.</p>

                <p>In an attempt to widen the stereo listening area, the Dimension 8 features columns of drivers (two woofers, a mid and a dome tweeter for treble) on two of the unusual 40-litre cabinet's sides. One column fired directly to listeners, while the other was heard via reflection from an adjacent wall. On the larger rear face of the distinctively-trapezoid cabinet is a passive radiator to enhance reproduction of low bass.</p>

                <p>Audiophiles partnering these 20kg speakers with modern equipment have praised the overall presentation (especially with jazz), although a slightly-recessed treble has been described.</p>

                <p>Back in 1974, a pair would have cost you £171.30; to set this in context, the same retailer would have relieved you of £213.40 for Quad Electrostatics (ESL57s). In surprisingly-good condition (thankfully, no foam driver surrounds here!), this Dimension 8 - and its stereo partner - could have been yours for £200.</p>

                <hr/>

                <p>Perhaps ironically, you could have snapped up a pair of Quad ESL57s that day for the same sum! The seller told me these were untested, and apparently came from a house clearance. Restoring ESLs is something of a specialist service, and doesn't come cheap. </p>
