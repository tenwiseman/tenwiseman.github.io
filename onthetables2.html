                <p>In 1973 or so, when the ghetto blasters so beloved of hip-hop culture were yet to hit the streets, you could have got a party swinging anywhere with this 16lb. Sanyo G2615 'briefcase stereo'.</p>

                <p>The lower section contains the electronics - FM/MW/SW tuner, low-power amplification, stereo cassette deck and rim-driven three-speed turntable with ceramic cartridge. Above the latter's tiny platter is a recess for the 45rpm adaptor that may have been necessary to spin those Sweet, early Queen, Bowie and Suzi Quatro singles. A pair of mikes was provided, for singalong sessions using a 'mix' facility. Mikes, radio or discs could be recorded onto ferric cassettes; unusually, the level is manually-adjusted, with the aid of a meter.</p>

                <p>Covering the electronics is a detachable lid, which splits into two single-driver stereo speakers. The G2615 could be sustained 'on the move' by six hefty 'D' cells, mains power being a practical alternative as soon as you got back home. Sanyo didn't however include everything - an optional plug-in 'widget' was needed to render your FM reception (note the telescopic whip aerial on the right) in glorious stereo! </p>

                <p>For a quintet of tenners, this evidently well cared-for G2615 could have made some collector's day. Hardly the ultimate in audio, but in '70s curio and film/TV prop terms the distinctive machine has definite appeal. You're almost guaranteed to come across such items at an Audiojumble.</p>
